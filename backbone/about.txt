A version of the site that uses backbone. Data is aquired from the rest api
and individual posts populated.

The basic concept is to try and create a data rich view of a blog for 4-8K
displays rather than worrying about the small screen overly. In addition this
version should be visually rich, making advanced use of CSS 3D and the canvas
element. Experimentation is good! 

I don't know what the "rails way" is of doing this and am actually trying to
see what the "JavaScript Way" is instead hence apart from the fact that the
api is provided via Rails, the backbone version should be viewed as 
"independant" as should the knockout, react and angular versions.
